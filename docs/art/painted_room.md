# Painted room (experiment)

A painted still made into a room, as an alternative to the Cycles plates (`docs/art/plates.md`).
`game/world/painted/painted_room.tscn` stands alone; nothing else uses it yet.

1. **Plate**: an image edit of the reference removes the characters (`tools/higgsfield`, Qwen Image 3 Edit,
   literal prompt, seed 7; provenance in `assets/painted/hall_clean/job_*.json`).
2. **Depth**: `tools/painted/build_painted.py` runs Depth Anything V2 Small (ONNX, CPU, about 3 s) and
   calibrates it to metres with the reference camera (55 degree lens, eye 1.3 m): the painted witch's
   size agrees within 3 %. The room is a 161x91 grid mesh carrying the painting by screen position, so
   from the painting's camera the frame is the painting. PSX mode: 640x360 texels, snapped vertices,
   affine mapping, 15-bit dither.
3. **Characters** stand on the calibrated floor, lit by `light_map.png` (the painting's floor seen
   from above, blurred) and the beam's colour.
4. **Props** (`props.json`, made by `tools/painted/lift_prop.py`): a second edit removes objects; the
   tool cuts each one out (diff, or a hand lasso with `--ellipse`/`--polygon`) onto a card at its
   nearest depth, and composites `plate_empty.png` behind it. A tap maps screen -> painting pixel ->
   nearest prop -> its next reaction (`wobble`, `hop`, `squash`, `shiver`, `spin`); `PaintedRoom.prop_pressed`
   is where Mirror events will hook in. `kind: "hotspot"` (a polygon, no moving part) is supported.

Limits seen in the captures: the camera holds about 15 cm of movement before depth edges smear;
a Dutch roll zooms in (the painting has no margin); the 3D characters don't match the painted designs.

Capture frames: see the header of `tools/painted/capture_painted.gd` for the xvfb command.
